    "### 2. Data exploration\n",
    "During data exploration, the following findings were discovered:\n",
    "- There are outliers in the price (e.g., extremely high or low prices) that may need to be addressed.\n",
    "- There is an add with coordinates not in Pakistan, which may need to be removed.\n",
    "- There are null values only in 'agent' and 'agency' columns, which just means that an add was posted by an individual without an agency. So we can say that there are no missing values in the data.\n",
    "- There is strong correlation between number of baths and number of bedrooms, which is expected.\n",
    "- Number of baths and bedrooms are highly correlated with price, indicating their importance in predicting house prices.\n",
    "- Area size and price are also correlated, suggesting that larger properties tend to have higher prices.\n",
    "- An average price for each property type and city are really different, which can be used as a feature for the model.\n",

    "The data requirements for this project are defined as follows:\n",
    "- Null values are allowed only in 'agent' and 'agency' columns.\n",
    "- **Property ID**: Unique identifier for each property.\n",
    "- **Location ID**: Unique identifier for each location.\n",
    "- **Latitude**: Should be within the range of 22 to 38 degrees.\n",
    "- **Longitude**: Should be within the range of 59 to 79 degrees.\n",
    "- **Price**: Should be greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "- **Baths**: Number of baths should be greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms should be greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "- **Area Size**: Value of area size should be greater than 0.\n",
    "- **Area Category**: Should be one of the predefined categories (e.g., \"0-5 Marla\").\n",
    "- **Area Type**: Should be either \"Marla\" or \"Kanal\".\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Should be either \"For Sale\" or \"For Rent\".\n",
    "- **Date Added**: Should be in a date format YEAR-MONTH-DAY (e.g., 2023-03-15).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Data quality verification report\n",
    "- **Completeness**: The data is complete in the sense that it covers all the required cases. All properties have the necessary information.\n",
    "- **Correctness**: The data appears to have rare outliers and no obvious errors. For example, there is 1 add along ~34000 values with coordinates not in Pakistan, which may need to be removed.\n",
    "- **Missing Values**: There are no missing values in the data except in 'agent' and 'agency' columns, which are logical.\n",
    "- Overall, the data quality is good, it is suitable for analysis and modeling. However, further cleaning and preprocessing may be required to address outliers and ensure data consistency."

Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks are manifested. Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase. Your project plan will be a dynamic document.
