    "#### 1. background\n",
    "Zameen.com is Pakistan's leading website for posting ads about houses and properties. The platform operates across various cities, facilitating the buying, selling, and renting of properties. Zameen.com maintains a rich dataset comprising property listings, transaction histories, and user interactions. The company aims to utilize this data to improve the accuracy of house price predictions and enhance the overall user experience on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. business problem\n",
    "Real estate businesses, such as Zameen.com, and real estate agents may struggle with accurately pricing houses, causing revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and competitive disadvantage. We propose developing a machine learning model to automate the evaluation of house prices using diverse data sources. This solution will enhance pricing accuracy, build customer trust, optimize pricing strategies and maximize profits through precise, data-driven property valuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. business objectives\n",
    "- Primary Objective: Improve the accuracy of house price predictions on the Zameen.com platform in order to:\n",
    "- Enhance customer satisfaction by offering fair and competitive property prices.\n",
    "- Reduce the time properties remain on the market by providing accurate initial pricing.\n",
    "- Increase revenue through optimized pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. ML objectives\n",
    "- Predict house prices based on property type, location, city, province name, coordinates, number of baths and bedrooms, and other relevant features."

    "- The data is not biased towards any specific property type or location based on the website's listings.\n",
    "- The data is not manipulated or altered in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Availability of resources: Limited access to cloud hardware, which may impact the scalability of the project;\n",
    "- Technological constraints: The size of the dataset may limit the complexity of the models that can be trained.\n",
    "- Time constraints: The project must be completed within 6 weeks, which may limit the scope of the analysis.\n",
    "- Budget constraints: Limited budget for cloud resources and additional tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Risks and contingencies\n",
    "Risks:\n",
    "- Data quality issues: Inaccurate or missing data may impact the time consumed for data cleaning and preprocessing;\n",
    "- Model performance: The models may not achieve the desired accuracy on the new data, leading to suboptimal results;\n",
    "- Resource constraints: Limited access to cloud hardware may slow down the training process and limit the scalability of the models.\n",
    "- Personnel constraints: The team may face challenges in coordinating tasks and managing time effectively. Moreover, if one of the team members will be unavailable for some time, it may impact the project timeline significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingencies:\n",
    "- Data quality issues: Implement data validation checks and data cleaning procedures to address inaccuracies and missing values;\n",
    "- Model performance: Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve model performance;\n",
    "- Resource constraints: Optimize code and use cloud resources efficiently, using local hardware for initial testing and development;\n",
    "- Personnel constraints: Regular team meetings and task tracking to ensure timely completion of project milestones. If one of the team members will be unavailable for some time, the rest of the team will redistribute the tasks and responsibilities to ensure the project timeline is met. If the project timeline is at risk, the team will consider reducing the scope of the project or seeking additional resources to meet the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Costs and benefits\n",
    "Costs:\n",
    "- Personnel costs: Salaries for data engineer, data scientist, and machine learning engineer;\n",
    "- Hardware costs: Cloud resources for training and testing models;\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Improved house price predictions on Zameen.com platform;\n",
    "- Enhanced user experience and customer satisfaction;\n",
    "- Increased revenue from optimized pricing strategies;\n",
    "- Improved understanding of the real estate market in Pakistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefit impact can be said to be high, while the costs impact is medium, so ratio benefits/costs is 3/2=1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Feasibility report\n",
    "Lasso regression model was built as a POC to predict house prices based on property features. The model achieved an R2 score of 0.3 on the test data, indicating a moderate level of predictive accuracy. The feasibility of the project is confirmed based on the available resources, data quality, and business objectives. The team is confident in proceeding with the project and will focus on refining the model and exploring additional features to improve predictive performance."
